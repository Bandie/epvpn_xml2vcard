# epvpn\_xml2vcard
For [EPVPN](https://www.eventphone.de): Takes the XML file you've downloaded before and generates a vCard (makes sense for Android and stuff).


## Usage

1. Get your brandnew™ EPVPN-XML file from the [EPVPN Phonebook](https://www.eventphone.de/guru2/epvpn/phonebook?format=xml). Maybe save it as `phonebook.xml`.
2. If not already done, set executable rights for the program through `chmod +x epvpn_xml2vcard`.
3. Run `./epvpn_xml2vcard -i phonebook.xml -o epvpn.vcf`.
4. Now you have a file named `epvpn.vcf` ready to import to Android™®©đ€¶@ŋŧ¶ or somewhere else.
